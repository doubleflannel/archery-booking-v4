## CHANGES: Radial Filtering Telemetry Breakdown

- Timestamp: 2025-10-24 19:38:44 local

### Context (before)
- The telemetry pipeline reports a single `radial_filtering` duration covering warp/subtract, distance map, radius estimate, thresholding, line detection, and contour reconstruction as one big lump.
- Developers can’t tell which sub-step (warp, Hough, morphology, etc.) is the bottleneck without additional profiling.

### Applied Change
- Split `radial_filtering` timing into six distinct buckets:
  1. `radial_warp_subtract`
  2. `radial_distance_map`
  3. `radial_ring_estimate`
  4. `radial_threshold_morph`
  5. `radial_line_detect`
  6. `radial_contour_reconstruct`
- Bookkeeping telemetry now tracks hit maintenance, grouping measurements, overlay draws, display/I/O, and idle/wait time as separate buckets while still reporting the total.
- Wrapped `VideoAnalyzer` and `VisualAnalyzer` steps with timers so each bucket (plus the original totals) records cost without altering behaviour, and the overall `radial_filtering` total is forced to match the sum of its sub-steps for consistency.
- `Scoreboard.write_run_report` now formats durations as `Xm YYs` without decimals and reports a single frame-total variance percentage alongside the run duration.

### NYC 10-year-old analogy
- Before: I timed the whole pizza-making routine, so I only knew “it took 10 minutes.”
- After: I clock dough stretch, sauce splash, cheese toss, bake, slice, and boxing separately—so when something’s slow, I know which step to hustle.
