## CHANGES: Fixed-Size ROI Output to Cut Bookkeeping I/O

### Context (before)
- Each frame is resized to a full preview resolution before drawing overlays.
- The entire frame is written to disk/display even though the target stays centered and only jitters slightly.
- Bookkeeping I/O dominates runtime because we touch far more pixels than necessary.

### Applied Change
- Track the target center per frame (reuse homography/LK flow), lock to a constant ROI (e.g., 1024×1024), and write/display only that cropped window.
- Keep `cv2.imshow` enabled for QC by showing the same ROI (no scalability hit), while `cv2.VideoWriter` stays locked to the ROI size to avoid reallocations.
- Future tweak: optionally skip the QC window in headless runs, but keep the code path ready for real-time review.

### NYC 10-year-old analogy
- Before: I painted the whole billboard every time I wanted to show my slice.
- After: I frame the pizza in a smaller window, tape that in the shop window, and if someone stops by, I still show them the same slice without repainting everything.
