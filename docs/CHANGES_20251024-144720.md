## CHANGES: Telemetry & Scoreboard Export

- Timestamp: 2025-10-24 14:47:20 local

### Runtime Telemetry Instrumentation
- Impacted scripts: `VideoAnalyzer.py`
- Technical details: Stopwatch probes (via `time.perf_counter`) now wrap the four major phases—target detection, radial filtering, hit scoring, and bookkeeping—accumulating per-phase totals that persist until the run completes. Each `analyze()` call resets trackers, clears historical hits, restarts LK state, and the telemetry exporter now formats durations as `Xm YY.YYYs` for easy reading. Bookkeeping timing covers hit reputation updates, grouping math, overlays, and display/write calls to capture control-loop overhead.
- NYC 10-year-old analogy: I’m clocking how long it takes to spot the pizza place, clean up the pie, count slices, and jot notes so I can brag about which part of the delivery night eats up my homework time.

### Scoreboard Text Reports
- Impacted scripts: `VideoAnalyzer.py`, `Scoreboard.py` (new), output directory `res/output/`
- Technical details: After processing finishes, `VideoAnalyzer` hands the aggregated telemetry, verified hit list, and run timing to `Scoreboard.write_run_report()`. The helper ensures `res/output/` exists, emits `scoreboard_<timestamp>.txt` with run metadata, per-phase timings expressed in minutes/seconds, totals, and a five-arrows-per-end table sourced from verified hit scores. The table auto-fills blanks with dashes and sums each end, supporting downstream logging or analytics.
- NYC 10-year-old analogy: When the match ends, I write a scoreboard sheet—what time we started, how long it took, who scored, and a neat row of five arrows per end—like jotting down playground hoops stats so my friends know the score without rewatching the game.
