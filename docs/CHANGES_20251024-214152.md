## CHANGES: Precomputed Ring Geometry

- Timestamp: 2025-10-24 21:41:52 local

### Context (before)
- Radial filtering estimates the targetâ€™s outer ring in every frame via Hough circles and distance math, costing ~3 minutes per run.
- Ring boundaries are discovered from the warped image rather than using the known dimensions of standard archery faces.

### Applied Change
- Stored canonical ring radii (in template pixels) derived from the inner ring width; after homography we scale them analytically instead of running Hough every frame.
- `VisualAnalyzer.emphasize_lines` now accepts a precomputed radius and skips the expensive circle search when provided.
- The pipeline still zeroes pixels outside the outer ring and runs the existing line detection, but avoids the multi-minute Hough pass while keeping accuracy.

### NYC 10-year-old analogy
- Before: I measured the pizza size every slice with a ruler.
- After: I remember the menu sizes, so once I know the box fits, I cut the slices without re-measuring.
