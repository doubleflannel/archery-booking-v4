# React Calculator

Simple two-number calculator built with React and Vite. It accepts decimal input (comma or dot), performs the four basic operations, and guards against invalid numbers and divide-by-zero.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev   # http://localhost:5173
```

## Production build

```bash
npm run build
```

The compiled assets are emitted to `dist/`. Zip that folder and move it into Swift Playgrounds when you are ready to wrap the app inside a `WKWebView`.
